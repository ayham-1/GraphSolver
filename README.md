# GraphSolver
An application for solving linear/quadratic graphs.
## Requirements file
After installing GraphSolver.zip to install requirements, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running App:
to start the app run: 

`python3 app.py`

and the menu window will pop up.
There is 4 options for graph:

1. Linear to graph a linear equation *y= mx + c*


2. Linear intercept to find the interception between two lines 


3. Quadratic to graph quadratic equation *y = ax^2 + bx + c*


4. Quadratic intercept to find the interception between two quadratic graphs
