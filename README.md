# GraphSolver
An application for solving linear/quadratic graphs and finding the interception.
## Requirements file
After installing GraphSolver.zip to install requirements, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running App:
to start the app run: 

`python3 app.py`

and the menu window will pop up.
There is 4 options for graph:

* **Linear to graph** a linear equation *y= mx + c*


* **Linear intercept** to find the interception between two lines 


* **Quadratic to graph** quadratic equation *y = ax^2 + bx + c*


* **Quadratic intercept** to find the interception between two quadratic graphs
